= Rest OAuth 2 Server

Rest Oauth2 Server is a gem to easily create your OAuth2 Server so that you can start sharing your
API in a secure and powerful way. The actual implementation is based on {draft 13}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13]
and allow you to obtain the authorization using one of the following 3 flows:

* {Authorization Code}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13#section-4.1]
* {Implicit Grant}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13#section-4.2]
* {Resource Owner Password Credentials}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13#section-4.3]

If you are not confortable with these terms is higly suggested for you to read the specification, which
explains in a clear and detailed way how OAuth2 works. It will help you on understanding better the tool
you are going to use.


== Installation

For the project to work, you need to have ruby 1.9.2 (or higher) and MongoDB[http://www.mongodb.org/]
which for now is the default database system. We use the handy Mondoid[mongoid.org] library to access
it. To install just clone the repository, install the missing gems with bundler and run your tests. If
everything is working correctly, you have your OAuth2 Server working!

  git clone git@github.com:Lelylan/rest-oauth2-server.git
  bundle install
  rake spec

We are working on a gem and a generator to easily integrate the OAuth server into your project. This is what
we want to reach.

  gem install rest-oauth2-server
  rails g oauth2

== Getting Started

Rest OAuth2 Server actually supports 3 authorization flows. Each of them can be used in specific situations
and is important to use the correct one for the correct goal.

=== Authorization Code Flow

The {Authorization Code}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13#section-4.1] is suitable for
clients capable of maintaining their client credentials confidential (for authenticating with the authorization
server) such as a client implemented on a secure server.  As a redirection-based flow, the client must be
capable of interacting with typically a web browser and capable of receiving incoming requests from the
authorization server. In greater detail, the authorization flow goes like this.

==== Authorization Code

Redirect the user to https://youroauthserver.com/oauth/authorize passing the following parameters in the query string
(to create a client go to the rails console and type Factory(:oauth_client), soon there will be a UI where you will be
able to easily create your clients)

  https://youroauthserver.com/oauth/authorize?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=https://youroauthserver.com/client/example&
    redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&
    scope=write

Lets explain in detail the params in the query string

* response_type - always use "code" as response type
* client_id - client identifier (in our case is the uri field of the client)
* redirect_uri - callback URL for the client application
* scope - privileges give to the client

In the authorization page the resource owner will be asked to grand or deny the access to the specific client for
a specif scope. If the resource owner 'grant' the access, the client will get back an authorization code that will
be used in a second step to have the access token, otherwise an error will be sent.

  #Â User response when the resource owner *grant* the access to its resources to a client
  https://example.com/callback?code=g2VDXwrT0S6iZeUeYQBYi2stxRy

  #User response when the resource owner *deny* the access to its resources to a client
  https://example.com/callback?access=denied
